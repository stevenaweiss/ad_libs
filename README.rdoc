== Ad Libs!

A take on a childhood favorite.  The user picks a story, and is asked to input words in different categories.  The results are often absurd and whimsical, which is usually my goal every day.  

The app was built with: 

* Ruby

* Rails 4

* Javascript

* jQuery

* Tested with Rspec, Capybara, and Jasmine


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
